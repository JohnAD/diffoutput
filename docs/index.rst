Introduction to diffoutput
==============================================================================
ver 0.1.1

This library provides a collection of supporting output methods for the
`diff <https://nimble.directory/pkg/diff>`_ library.

In addition to the ``diff`` library requirement that the sequences of ``T`` have
procedures supporting ``==`` and ``hash()``, this library also requires that
the sequences support stringification with ``$``. For the recovery procedures,
a parsing procedure is needed for converting the ``$`` string back into ``T``.
